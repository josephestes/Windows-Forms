# Windows-Forms


The purpose of these programs are to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts using the C# programming language. Concepts include data types, control structures, simple data structures, error-handling, object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces, and modular programming.


The goals for this project are to:

1. Demonstrate knowledge of the program development life cycle.
2. Design, develop, compile, debug, test, run, and document programs in the C# language.
3. Design and develop programs using operators and assignments.
4. Design and develop programs using primitive data types.
5. Design and develop programs that use sequence, selection, and repetition structures.
6. Design and develop programs that use array data structures.
7. Design and develop programs that use effective error and exception handling.
8. Design and develop programs that implement user-defined methods and modular programming.
9. Design and develop programs that implement file processing.
10. Design and develop event-driven programs that work with a graphical user interface (GUI).
11. Design and develop programs using object-oriented programming features.
12. Evaluate and critique effectiveness and efficiency of code.
